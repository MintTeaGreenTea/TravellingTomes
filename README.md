# Travelling Tomes
Travelling Tomes is the projected ideated and developed by Group 1 (Antara Ballal, Area Guede Ramos, Eniko Takacs, Isabel Davis, and Sara Zanetti) of the Spring 2024 Web Information Systems course. Here you can find all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript written to bring this project to fruition.

## What is Travelling Tomes?
Travelling Tomes is a book-sharing experience; through this simple social media, users can easily upload the books they wish to lend or ask for the posted books to borrow.

The user can easily find their way through the website with the navigation bar on top. They can learn more about the project, find spots to exchange their books (only in Leuven for now, but further development of this project would require involving coffeeshops, bookshops, and other such venues from other places in the world), submit their books for lending or explore the books available, or read more about the team. 

## Responsiveness
The website is fully responsive regardless of the device used to access it.

## Users
Although users from all backgrounds and ages are welcomed in Travelling Tomes, the team determined that users from the millenial and gen-z generations will use it the most. As such, the language used is colloquial and casual, the website models easily recognizable esthetics (more on this below), and it emphasizes the sustainability impact of the project. 

## Design
The website tries to follow a color scheme corresponding to a "light academia" esthetic and similar to those used in Goodreads. Soft, pastel-ish colors were favored throughout the website. In spite of the simplicity of the general design, the team also emphasized a visually pleasant experience with beautiful graphics throughout. Additionally, due to the emphasis on sustainability, a nature theme also appears on the website, further highlighting the impact this initiative could have in reducing paper consumption. All graphics were designed using Canva.
